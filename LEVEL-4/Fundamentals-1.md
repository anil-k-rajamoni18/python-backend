## 📘 Introduction to Java

- Java is a **general-purpose**, **object-oriented**, and **class-based** programming language developed with the philosophy of **"write once, run anywhere" (WORA)**. 
- This means that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of computer architecture or operating system.


---

### 🔑 Key Features of Java

- **Platform Independent:** Java code is compiled into bytecode which can run on any JVM.
- **Object-Oriented:** Everything in Java is treated as an object, promoting code reusability.
- **Robust and Secure:** Strong memory management, lack of pointers, and a strong exception handling system.
- **Multithreaded:** Java supports multithreading at the language level, enabling high-performance applications.
- **Architecture Neutral:** No dependency on hardware architecture or operating system.
- **Distributed:** Java is designed to make distributed computing easy with integrated networking libraries.
- **High Performance:** Through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and optimized memory management.
- **Dynamic and Extensible:** Supports dynamic linking of new class libraries and methods during runtime.

## 📜 History of Java

- **1991**: Java started as a project called **"Oak"** by **James Gosling**, **Mike Sheridan**, and **Patrick Naughton** at Sun Microsystems. 
- The project was part of a larger effort called the **Green Project** aimed at developing software for consumer electronics.

- The name "Java" was chosen after much deliberation. The developers wanted a name that was **unique, easy to spell, and fun**. It was inspired by **Java coffee**, from Indonesia.

## 📚 Java Terminologies

### 1. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
A full-featured software development kit required to develop Java applications. It includes:
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- Java Compiler (`javac`)
- Debugging tools, libraries, etc.

### 2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
A set of software tools for running Java programs. It includes:
- Java class libraries
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

> 📝 *JDK = JRE + Development tools*

### 3. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
An abstract machine that enables your Java program to be executed on any platform. It:
- Loads class files
- Verifies code
- Executes bytecode
- Manages memory (via Garbage Collection)

### 4. **Bytecode**
Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler. It’s platform-independent and is executed by the JVM.

### 5. **Class**
A blueprint from which individual objects are created. It defines the structure and behavior (data + methods).

### 6. **Object**
An instance of a class that contains real values. It represents an entity with a state and behavior.

### 7. **Method**
A block of code designed to perform a specific task, defined inside a class.


### 8. **Main Method**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {}
```
- This is the entry point of every standalone Java application.
    - public: Accessible from outside the class.
    - static: No object is required to call it.
    - void: Does not return a value.
    - String[] args: Accepts command-line arguments.


---
## 💻 First Java Program & Explanation

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

- public class HelloWorld: Defines a class named HelloWorld.
    - public: Access modifier – visible to all.
- public static void main(String[] args): Main method – entry point for JVM.
- System.out.println("Hello, World!");: Outputs the text to the console.

**🔧 Compilation & Execution**
- Save the file as HelloWorld.java.
- Compile it: This creates a file HelloWorld.class (bytecode).
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```
- Run it:
```bash
java HelloWorld
```

## 📝 Comments in Java

Comments are used to make code more readable and to explain the logic of the program. They are ignored by the compiler.

### 🔹 Types of Comments

1. **Single-line Comment**
```java
// This is a single-line comment
```

2. **Multi-line Comment**
```java
/*
 This is a multi-line comment
 It can span multiple lines
*/
```

3. **Documentation Comment**
```java
/**
 * This is a documentation comment
 * It is used to generate JavaDoc documentation
 */
```

## 🧮 Variables
> Variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable in Java has a type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory.

**syntax**
```java
type variableName = value;

int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
```

**Variable Naming Rules**
- Must begin with a letter, $, or _
- Cannot be a Java keyword
- Case-sensitive
- Meaningful names are recommended

**Types of Variables**
1. Local Variables
- Declared inside a method or block, accessible only within it.

2. Instance Variables
- Declared in a class but outside any method; each object has its own copy.

3. Static Variables (Class variables)
- Declared with static; shared across all objects of the class.

```java
public class VariableExample {

    // Static variable (Class variable)
    static int staticCounter = 0;

    // Instance variable
    int instanceCounter = 0;

    public void demonstrateVariables() {
        // Local variable
        int localCounter = 0;

        localCounter++;
        instanceCounter++;
        staticCounter++;

        System.out.println("Local Counter: " + localCounter);
        System.out.println("Instance Counter: " + instanceCounter);
        System.out.println("Static Counter: " + staticCounter);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VariableExample obj1 = new VariableExample();
        VariableExample obj2 = new VariableExample();

        System.out.println("First Object:");
        obj1.demonstrateVariables();

        System.out.println("\nSecond Object:");
        obj2.demonstrateVariables();
    }
}
```

## Data Types and Type Casting
> Java is statically typed — every variable must be declared with a data type.

| Type    | Category  | Size    | Example             |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| byte    | Integer   | 1 byte  | `byte b = 100;`     |
| short   | Integer   | 2 bytes | `short s = 1000;`   |
| int     | Integer   | 4 bytes | `int x = 10;`       |
| long    | Integer   | 8 bytes | `long l = 100000L;` |
| float   | Floating  | 4 bytes | `float f = 10.5f;`  |
| double  | Floating  | 8 bytes | `double d = 99.99;` |
| char    | Character | 2 bytes | `char c = 'A';`     |
| boolean | Logical   | 1 bit   | `boolean b = true;` |

**Type Casting**
> Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another.

**1. Implicit Casting (Widening)**
- Automatically done when converting a smaller type to a larger type.

```java
int a = 10;
double b = a;  // int to double
```

**2. Explicit Casting (Narrowing)**
- Manually done when converting a larger type to a smaller type.
```java
double x = 10.5;
int y = (int)x;  // double to int
```

## Operators in Java
> Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

**🔹 1. Arithmetic Operators**
- Perform basic math operations.

| Operator | Description         | Example |

```java
public class JavaConceptsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 📝 Single-line comment: Declaring variables of different types

        // 🔢 Primitive Data Types
        int age = 25;                  // Integer
        double height = 5.9;           // Double
        char grade = 'A';              // Character
        boolean isPass = true;         // Boolean

        // 🧮 Arithmetic Operators
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3;
        int sum = a + b;
        int difference = a - b;
        int product = a * b;
        int quotient = a / b;
        int remainder = a % b;

        // 📦 Type Casting
        double weight = 72.5;
        int castedWeight = (int) weight;  // Explicit casting (double to int)

        // 🧠 Relational & Logical Operators
        boolean isAdult = age >= 18;
        boolean isEligible = isAdult && isPass;

        // 🛠 Assignment Operators
        int score = 50;
        score += 10;   // score = score + 10

        System.out.println("Updated Score: " + score);
        System.out.println("Final Counter Value: " + counter);
    }
}
```

### **➕ Ternary Operator**
- The **ternary operator** is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. 
- It's also known as the **conditional operator** and is the only operator in Java that takes **three operands**.

**🔹 Syntax**
```java
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
- If condition is true, expression1 is evaluated and returned.
- If condition is false, expression2 is evaluated and returned.

```java
int age = 20;
String result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
System.out.println(result); 
```

```java
int marks = 85;
String grade = (marks >= 90) ? "A" :
               (marks >= 75) ? "B" :
               (marks >= 60) ? "C" : "Fail";
System.out.println(grade); 
```

## Operator Precedence
- Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. 
- Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.

**Precedence Table (Highest to Lowest)**
| Precedence Level | Operators                          | Category               |            |            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 (Highest)      | `()`                               | Parentheses / Grouping |            |            |
| 2                | `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`, `~`, `!`     | Unary operators        |            |            |
| 3                | `*`, `/`, `%`                      | Multiplicative         |            |            |
| 4                | `+`, `-`                           | Additive               |            |            |
| 5                | `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`                  | Shift                  |            |            |
| 6                | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `instanceof` | Relational             |            |            |
| 7                | `==`, `!=`                         | Equality               |            |            |
| 8                | `&`                                | Bitwise AND            |            |            |
| 9                | `^`                                | Bitwise XOR            |            |            |
| 10               | \`                                 | \`                     | Bitwise OR |            |
| 11               | `&&`                               | Logical AND            |            |            |
| 12               | \`                                 |                        | \`         | Logical OR |
| 13               | `?:`                               | Ternary (conditional)  |            |            |
| 14               | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.        | Assignment             |            |            |


```java
int result = 10 + 2 * 5;   

int result = (10 + 2) * 5; 
```

**Associativity**
- When operators have the same precedence, associativity determines the direction of evaluation:

| Type                | Associativity |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| Most Binary Ops     | Left to Right |
| Assignment, Ternary | Right to Left |

## 🧾 Input in JAVA

## 📥 Ways to Take Input in Java

Java provides **three main ways** to receive input from the user or the outside world:

- ✅ Using `Scanner` class  
- ✅ Using `BufferedReader` class  
- ✅ Using **Command Line Arguments**

---

## 🔁 System Streams

- `System.in` → Standard **input** stream (e.g., keyboard)
- `System.out` → Standard **output** stream (e.g., console)

---

## 🔎 Using `Scanner` Class

- Java `Scanner` class allows input from the console.
- Belongs to the `java.util` package.
- Used to read inputs of primitive types: `int`, `double`, `long`, `short`, `float`, `byte`, etc.
- Easiest and most common method for basic input.

### 🔧 Syntax:

```java
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
```

**📚 Common Methods**
| Method             | Description                         | Example                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `next()`           | Reads next token (word) as `String` | `"Hello"` from `"Hello World"` |
| `nextLine()`       | Reads entire line as `String`       | `"Hello World"`                |
| `nextInt()`        | Reads next token as `int`           | `"42"` becomes `42`            |
| `nextFloat()`      | Reads next token as `float`         | `"2.718f"` becomes `2.718`     |
| `nextDouble()`     | Reads next token as `double`        | `"3.14"` becomes `3.14`        |
| `nextBoolean()`    | Reads next token as `boolean`       | `"true"` becomes `true`        |
| `nextByte()`       | Reads next token as `byte`          | `"127"` becomes `127`          |
| `next().charAt(0)` | Reads a single character            | `"H"` from `"Hello"`           |


### Using BufferedReader
- Used to read a sequence of characters efficiently.
- Part of java.io package.
- Requires an InputStreamReader to convert byte stream into character stream.
- Character-based (ideal for reading text)
- Efficient for reading entire lines

```java
BufferedReader bfn = new BufferedReader(
    new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

**📚 Methods**
| Method       | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `read()`     | Reads a single character, returns `int` (-1 if end) |
| `readLine()` | Reads an entire line as a `String` (null if end)    |


```java
BufferedReader bfn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

String str = bfn.readLine();
int it = Integer.parseInt(bfn.readLine());
float ft = Float.parseFloat(bfn.readLine());
double salary = Double.parseDouble(bfn.readLine());

System.out.println("Entered String : " + str);
System.out.println("Entered Integer : " + it);
```

---
## 🖨 Output in JAVA

**💡 System.out**
- Standard output stream that prints text to the console.
- Most basic and straightforward method for producing output.

**Output Methods**

1. System.out.print()
- Prints text without a newline

```java
System.out.print("Hello");
System.out.print(" World"); // Output: Hello World
```
2. 🔸 System.out.println()
- Prints text with a newline
```java
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.println("World");
// Output:
// Hello
// World
```

3. 🔸 System.out.printf()
- Prints formatted output using format specifiers
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "John";

System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d%n", name, age);

// instead of 
System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
```

**Format Specifiers**
| Specifier | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `%s`      | String                          |
| `%d`      | Integer (decimal)               |
| `%f`      | Floating-point number           |
| `%n`      | New line (platform-independent) |

**🛠️ Other Output Options**
- PrintWriter: Advanced text output (to files or streams)
- StringBuilder: Efficient for large/complex strings
- Logger: Recommended for logging in large applications

## 🔹 Conditional Statements
> Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.

#### 1️⃣ if Statement
Executes a block of code **if** the condition is true.

```java
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
}
```

#### 2️⃣ if-else Statement
- Executes one block if the condition is true, another if it’s false.
```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("Minor");
}
```

#### 3️⃣ if-else-if Ladder
- Checks multiple conditions.
```java
int score = 75;
if (score >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Grade A");
} else if (score >= 75) {
    System.out.println("Grade B");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    System.out.println("Grade C");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
```
#### 4️⃣ switch Statement
- Selects one of many blocks of code to execute.

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

## 🔁 Looping Statements
- Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly under a condition.

#### 1️⃣ for Loop
- Used when the number of iterations is known.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```

#### 2️⃣ while Loop
- Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("While loop: " + i);
    i++;
}
```

#### 3️⃣ do-while Loop
- Similar to while, but executes at least once.
```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Do-while loop: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

#### 4️⃣ Enhanced for Loop (for-each loop)
- Used to iterate over arrays or collections.
```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + num);
}
```

#### 🔄 Loop Control Statements
| Statement  | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `break`    | Exits the loop early                                    |
| `continue` | Skips the current iteration and continues with the next |


```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) continue;  // Skip when i == 3
    if (i == 5) break;     // Stop when i == 5
    System.out.println("i = " + i);
}
```

## 🔤 Strings in Java
- A **String** is a sequence of characters.
- In Java, **Strings are objects** of the `String` class, backed internally by a `char[]` array.
- **Immutable**: Once created, a String cannot be changed.

### 🔹 Creating Strings

```java
String s1 = "Hello";              // String literal
String s2 = new String("World");  // Using constructor
```

**🔹 String Methods**
| Method               | Description                            | Example                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `length()`           | Returns length of string               | `s1.length()` → `5`                    |
| `charAt(int)`        | Returns char at index                  | `s1.charAt(0)` → `'H'`                 |
| `substring(a, b)`    | Extracts substring from index a to b-1 | `s1.substring(1, 4)` → `"ell"`         |
| `equals(String)`     | Compares strings (case-sensitive)      | `s1.equals("Hello")` → `true`          |
| `equalsIgnoreCase()` | Case-insensitive comparison            | `s1.equalsIgnoreCase("hello")`         |
| `compareTo(String)`  | Lexicographical comparison             | `"abc".compareTo("xyz")` → `-23`       |
| `toLowerCase()`      | Converts to lowercase                  | `s1.toLowerCase()` → `"hello"`         |
| `toUpperCase()`      | Converts to uppercase                  | `s1.toUpperCase()` → `"HELLO"`         |
| `trim()`             | Removes leading/trailing spaces        | `" hello ".trim()` → `"hello"`         |
| `replace(a, b)`      | Replaces characters                    | `"abc".replace("a", "x")` → `"xbc"`    |
| `split(String)`      | Splits based on regex                  | `"a,b,c".split(",")` → `["a","b","c"]` |


**🔹 String Concatenation**
```java
String name = "Java";
String result = name + " Programming"; // "Java Programming"

// OR 
result = name.concat(" Programming");
```

**🔹 Comparing Strings (Avoid ==)**
```java
String a = "hello";
String b = new String("hello");

System.out.println(a == b);         // false (compares reference)
System.out.println(a.equals(b));    // true (compares value)
```

### 🔹StringBuffer (Thread Safe)
- used for mutable string operations.
- Thread-safe: Can be safely used in multi-threaded environments.
- Methods like append(), insert(), etc., are synchronized.
- Best for multi-threaded applications where multiple threads may access the same instance.
- Ensures data consistency and integrity during concurrent access.

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World

```

### 🔹 StringBuilder (Not Thread Safe)
- Used to create mutable sequences of characters.
- Similar to StringBuffer, but not synchronized.
- Not thread-safe: Multiple threads accessing the same instance without synchronization can cause issues.
- Faster performance than StringBuffer in single-threaded environments.
- Methods (e.g., append(), insert(), delete()) modify the same object without creating new strings.

> Ideal for string manipulation in single-threaded applications. Suitable when thread safety is not a concern.

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World
```

**🔸 Comparison**

| Feature       | StringBuilder      | StringBuffer         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Thread Safety | ❌ Not thread-safe  | ✅ Thread-safe        |
| Performance   | ✅ Faster (no sync) | ❌ Slower (sync cost) |
| Introduced In | Java 5             | Java 1.0             |
| Best Used In  | Single-threaded    | Multi-threaded       |
| Mutable?      | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                |

## 📦 Arrays in Java

- An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
- Arrays are indexed starting at 0.
- Arrays in Java are objects.

```java
int[] arr1;                // Declaration
arr1 = new int[5];         // Memory allocation

int[] arr2 = new int[3];   // Declaration + allocation

int[] arr3 = {10, 20, 30}; // Declaration + initialization
```

**Accessing & Modifying Arrays**
```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
System.out.println(nums[0]);   // Output: 1
nums[1] = 99;                  // Modify second element
```

**🔹 Looping Through Arrays**
```java
// Using for Loop
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(nums[i]);
}

// Using Enhanced for Loop (for-each)

for (int num : nums) {
    System.out.println(num);
}

```

### 🔹 Multidimensional Arrays
- A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. 
- In Java, the most common form is a 2D array, but you can have 3D or even more dimensions.

**🔸 Use Cases:**
- Storing tabular data (like rows and columns).
- Matrices in math/graphics.
- Grids in games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe).
- 3D modeling (with 3D arrays).


**🔸 Syntax:**
```java
// Declaration

int[][] matrix;         // 2D array
int[][][] cube;         // 3D array

// Initialization:
int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];  // 3 rows, 4 columns


// Initialization with values:
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};

```

**Accessing Elements:**
```java
int x = matrix[0][2];  
matrix[1][1] = 10;     
```

**Iterating Over a 2D Array:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

**🔸 Jagged Arrays:**
- Java supports jagged arrays, where rows can have different lengths.
```java
int[][] jagged = new int[3][];
jagged[0] = new int[2];  // Row 0 has 2 columns
jagged[1] = new int[4];  // Row 1 has 4 columns
jagged[2] = new int[1];  // Row 2 has 1 column
```

## 🔤 Strings – Key Points & Observations

1. **Strings are Immutable:**
   - Any modification (e.g., concatenation, replace) results in a **new object**.
   - Helps in memory optimization (String Pool), but can impact performance in repetitive modifications.

2. **Memory Management:**
   - String literals are stored in the **String Constant Pool**.
   - `String s = "Java";` uses the pool.
   - `String s = new String("Java");` creates a new object in the heap.

3. **Avoid Using `==` for Comparison:**
   - `==` compares **references**, not content.
   - Always use `.equals()` or `.equalsIgnoreCase()` to compare **values**.

4. **Use StringBuilder/StringBuffer for Modifications:**
   - `StringBuilder`: Fast, not thread-safe.
   - `StringBuffer`: Thread-safe, but slower.
   - Ideal for loops or heavy string manipulations.

5. **Strings are Backed by char Arrays Internally:**
   - Immutable due to security and efficiency (especially in multi-threaded applications).

6. **Useful Methods to Remember:**
   - `.length()`, `.charAt()`, `.substring()`, `.indexOf()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.trim()`

7. **Strings Can Be Concatenated Using `+` or `concat()`**

## 📦 Arrays – Key Points & Observations

1. **Fixed Size:**
   - Arrays are of fixed length; you **cannot resize** an array after creation.
   - Use `ArrayList` for dynamic resizing.

2. **Same Data Type:**
   - All elements must be of the same type (e.g., `int[]`, `String[]`).

3. **Index Starts at 0:**
   - Last element is at index `length - 1`.

4. **Default Values:**
   - Numeric types → `0`
   - Boolean → `false`
   - Object/Reference → `null`

5. **Multidimensional Arrays:**
   - Declare as `int[][] matrix = new int[2][3];`
   - Jagged arrays allowed (`rows` can have different `column` lengths).

6. **Accessing Array Length:**
   - Use `.length` (no parentheses).
   - For 2D arrays: `array.length` for rows, `array[0].length` for columns.

7. **Looping Techniques:**
   - Use `for`, `while`, or `for-each` loops.
   - `for-each` is simpler for read-only traversal.

8. **Array is an Object:**
   - All arrays in Java are objects, even if they hold primitive types.
   - You can access them with methods like `.getClass()`, and they inherit from `Object`.

9. **Arrays Can Store Objects:**
   ```java
   String[] names = new String[3];
   Student[] students = new Student[10];  // Array of objects
   ```
