## 1. ✅ What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is an **open-source web application** that allows you to create and share documents containing:

- Live **code** (supports Python and many other languages)  
- **Equations** (using LaTeX)  
- **Visualizations** (graphs, charts)  
- **Narrative text** (formatted notes, explanations)

- 🖥️ Jupyter Notebook works on a client-server model.
- ▶️ You start the server by running the command: jupyter notebook.
- 🌐 The interface opens automatically in your default web browser on port 8888.
- 💻 It is a web-based interactive interpreter for running code.
- 🌍 Supports multiple languages via different kernels, but by default, it includes only the Python kernel.

It is widely used for **data analysis, machine learning, scientific research, and teaching**.

## 3. ✍️ How to Write Code and Notes in Jupyter Notebook

### Notebook is made of **cells**:

- **Code Cells**  
  - Write Python (or other supported languages) code here  
  - Run the code, and output appears just below the cell  

- **Markdown Cells**  
  - Write formatted text using **Markdown syntax**  
  - Add headings, bullet points, links, images, and LaTeX equations  
  - Useful for explanations, comments, and documentation
